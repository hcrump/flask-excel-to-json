                Science fiction plucks from within
                us our deepest fears and hopes then
                shows them to us in rough disguise:
                the monster and the rocket.

                                     W.H. Auden



                We live, as we dream -- alone.

        FADE IN

        SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE:

        INT. ENGINE ROOM

        Empty, cavernous.

        INT. ENGINE CUBICLE

        Circular, jammed with instruments.
        All of them idle.
        Console chairs for two.
        Empty.
